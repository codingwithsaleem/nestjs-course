# nest js course 

***Introduction***

nest js is used to build server side applications in nodejs it is build in top of the nodejs
, express js and typescript.

the main difference between nestjs and other major nest js project is it using typescript and it is using angular architecture angular concepts on the backend.

JavaScript has become the “lingua franca” of the web for both front and backend applications. This has given rise to awesome projects like Angular, React and Vue, which improve developer productivity and enable the creation of fast, testable, and extensible frontend applications. However, while plenty of superb libraries, helpers, and tools exist for Node (and server-side JavaScript), none of them effectively solve the main problem of architecture.

Nest provides an out-of-the-box application architecture which allows developers and teams to create highly testable, scalable, loosely coupled, and easily maintainable applications. The architecture is heavily inspired by Angular.

***Installation***

To scaffold the project with the Nest CLI, run the following commands. This will create a new project directory, and populate the directory with the initial core Nest files and supporting modules, creating a conventional base structure for your project. 

\`\`\`bash
npm i -g @nestjs/cli
nest new project-name
\`\`\`
